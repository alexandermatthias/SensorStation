The 2nd video had the fritzing diagram from an Uno to a Mega


Basically:
1. Choose the port as normal
2. Choose the board you are using as normal 
3. Load the Example code (Saved int his folder) 
4. Modify the Example coad to use 'old style wiring'  it's a single line that needs to be uncommented, about 1/4 through the sketch. 
5. Set the programmer to Arduino as ISP (it was set as AVRISP mkll)... I am actually not 
sure which programmer was selected when I uplaoded the sketch to the arduino board. 
6. Upload the sketch to the 'Sender' board (this is the board you are using to do the work, no the one to be reprogrammed) 
7. Then go to tools 'Burn Bootloader'
